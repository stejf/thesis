This directory contains four folders:
    * pkgSHC/       : code/ documentation implementing the SHC procedure,
    * sims/         : code used for the simulations presented in the paper

    = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
    * pkgSHC/ directory

    The "pkgSHC/" directory is structured similar to a traditional R package,
    and may be loaded from the R command line by:
        R> devtools::load_all("pkgSHC")

    The package contains three main functions:
        * shc()  : the testing procedure,
        * plot() : the corresponding plotting procedure,
        * diagnostic() : the corresponding diagnostic plotting procedure.

    A more complete and up-to-date version of this package is actively maintained
    at: http://github.com/pkimes/sigclust2

    * sims/ directory

    The "sims/" directory contains R scripts which were used to perform the 
    simulations presented in the accompanying paper. This includes:
        * sims.R          : the main simulation script, called as described below
        * sims_parse.R    : script for creating results tables from output 
                            generated by sims.R
        * shc_settings.R  : function for matching a simulation number to simulation 
                            parameters
        * shc_simulator.R : function for simulating data from a mixture distribution
                            using parameters passed from shc_settings.R
        * shc_helpers.R   : helper functions for sims_parse.R

    The main simulation script, "sims.R" can be run from the Linux command line with five
    parameters, using the "Rscript" command. For example:
        > Rscript sims.R 1 1 1000

    The five parameters to be passed are described at the top of "sims.R". An example
    shell script used for running the simulations on an HPC computing 
    cluster is given by "my_submission_script.txt" in the same directory.

    The R Script "sims_parse.R" can be run from the Linux command line with five
    parameters, using the "Rscript" command. For example:
	> Rscript sims_parse.R "outputs" 1 1 1000 "_test"
