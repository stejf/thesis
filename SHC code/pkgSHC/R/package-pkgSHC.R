#' Statistical Significance for Hierarchical Clustering
#'
#' This package implements a significance testing procedure for hierarchical
#' clustering based on the assumption that a cluster may be well approximated as a
#' single Gaussian distribution. The procedure is particularly well-suited for
#' the high-dimension low-sample size setting when the number of dimensions
#' greatly outnumbers the number of observations.
#' A more complete and up-to-date version of this package is actively maintained
#' at: http://github.com/pkimes/sigclust2 .
